# Repetition Hunter

Do you repeat yourself in your code? This is for you. It finds
repetitions in your code.

Add `[repetition-hunter "0.3.0"]` to the `:dependencies` of your
`:user` profile.

## Usage

You should use it from the REPL:

    user=> (use 'repetition.hunter)
    nil
    user=> (require 'your.namespace)
    nil
    user=> (hunt 'your.namespace)
    2 repetitions of complexity 5

    Line 474 - your.namespace:
    (or (modifiers->str mname) (name mname))

    Line 479 - your.namespace:
    (or (modifiers->str m) (name m))

    ======================================================================

    3 repetitions of complexity 5

    Line 50 - your.namespace:
    (str "(" (first t) ")")

    Line 294 - your.namespace:
    (str "(" (first f) ")")

    Line 360 - your.namespace:
    (str "(" (first c) ")")

    ======================================================================

    2 repetitions of complexity 7

    Line 162 - your.namespace:
    (str/join ", " (map (partial identifier->str db) column))

    Line 170 - your.namespace:
    (str/join ", " (map (partial identifier->str db) column))

    ======================================================================
    nil

Each repetition is presented with a header showing the number of repetitions
and their complexity. Complexity is the count of flatten the form
`(count (flatten (form)))`. It is sorted by default by complexity, from less
complex to more complex.

Now it also support multiple namespaces. Require them all and pass a list to
hunt:

    user=> (hunt '(your.namespace1 your.namespace2 your.namespace3))

You can also sort by repetitions using the optional parameter `:repetition`
like this:

    user=> (hunt 'your.namespace :sort :repetition)

There are filters:

    user=> (hunt 'your.namespace :filter {:min-repetition 2
                                          :min-complexity 5
                                          :remove-flat true})

The filters default to :min-repetition 2, :min-complexity 3 and :remove-flat false
Remove flat is a filter to remove flat forms.

After the header the repeated code is shown with the line number and namespace.

If it doesn't find repetitions it doesn't print anything.

That's it. Now go refactor your code.
