# Repetition Hunter

Do you repeat yourself in your code? This is for you. It finds
repetitions in your code.

Add `[repetition-hunter "0.2.0"]` to the `:dependencies` of your
`:user` profile.

## Usage

You should use it from the REPL:

    user=> (use 'repetition.hunter)
    nil
    user=> (require 'your.namespace)
    nil
    user=> (hunt 'your.namespace)
    2 repetitions of complexity 9

    On line 575:
    (format
    "\"%s\" expected %s %s, found %s %s"
    "sql-params"
    "vector"
    "[sql param*]"
    (.getName sql-params-class)
    (pr-str sql-params))

    On line 937:
    (format
    "\"%s\" expected %s %s, found %s %s"

    "vector"
    "[sql param*]"
    (.getName sql-params-class)
    (pr-str sql-params))

Each repetition is presented with a header showing the number of repetitions
and their complexity. Complexity is the count of flatten the form
`(count (flatten (form)))`. It is sorted by default by complexity, from less
complex to more complex. You can also sort by repetitons using the optional
parameter `:repetition` like this:

    user=> (hunt 'your.namespace :repetition)

After the header the repeated code is shown with the line number.
If it doesn't find repetitions it doesn't print anything.

That's it. Now go refactor your code.
